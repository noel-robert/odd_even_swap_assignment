##Problem Statement: Swapping Digits

**Write a program in Java that accepts the integer ‘n’ and performs the following steps:**

    **If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is even, swap the first and second digit, the third and fourth digit, the fifth and sixth digit, and so on.**

    **If the total number of digits in the integer ‘n’ is odd, then the first digit remains unchanged and swapping begins from the second digit.**

**For example, in the integer 564783, there are a total number of 6 digits. Here, the number 6 is an even number. The new integer after swapping this integer will be 657438.
However, in the integer 512364783, there are a total number of 9 digits. Here, the number 9 is an odd number. The new integer after swapping this integer will be 521637438.  In this case, the first digit remains unchanged and the swap begins from the second digit.**

    ## Example

#### Sample Input:

    Number = 564783L

#### Expected Output :

    SwappedNumber = 657438L
